         Yiyi Su 
         I'm a dual major student studying Television, Radio & Film and Information Management & Technology. I'm interested entertainment industry and willing to find a position in the industry.
         Technical Skills: Python, SQL, Microsoft Words, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Excel, Adobe Pr, Adobe Au, Google Suite.
         I enjoy watching movies, with a frequency of once a week. Currently, my favorite movie type is drama, a type that usaully has more dialogue than action. I hope I can be part of a team that promoting great films come to reality in the future.
