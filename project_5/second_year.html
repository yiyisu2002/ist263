We have no idea how long that opossum baby was trapped in the sewer but thank God he was still alive when we saw him. We fed him some milk then released him.</p>

I got my own ambassador T-shirt, name card, and student ID access to the Dick Clark Studio, and I've kept them and will continue to keep them in the future.</p>

                <p>I took two 4-credit courses during the summer in Onondaga Community College, a biology and a statistic, to fulfill my “science with lab” and “math with lab” requirements. The biology was an in-person course that began at 8am and ended at 3pm with a 30-mins break. I remember that when I first saw the syllabus I had planned to do well in labs, quizzes, and the first three exams so I can skip the final exam but still receive credit for it, then I failed the first exam…HOWEVER I successfully got a B at the end and credit for the course!</p>

                <p>I spent the whole semester figuring out if I want to do advertising or keep doing film, I understand that Newhouse has one of the top advertising programs in the US, and I can find a job easily after graduation. But I am not sure if I enjoy creating content that people always choose to skip while watching video. I changed my major and took an advertising class, then I realized that I don’t really want to do it for my whole life, </p>

                <p>Went to Watkins Glens State Park to catch the fall with my special one, we walked down through the Gorge Trail from the top of the mountain and expected to come back by shuttle. Unfortunately, there wasn't a shuttle that day, so we had to walk back.  A bit tired but we were still happy since we enjoyed the wonderful views.</p>

                <p>Another coding class. Prof. Kingma told me that many alumni point to IST359 as the most useful course they took for their careers, I believe it to be true. Glad I took this class with a good professor, Prof. Ferger. I thought SQL was easier than Python, or at least it made more sense to me. </p>
