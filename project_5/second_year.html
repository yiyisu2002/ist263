                <p>Saved a little opossum from the sewer in the backyard in my family’s house, this little life was tried to play dead when we pick it up from the sewer. We have no idea of how long that opossum baby had trapped in the sewer but thank God he was still alive when we saw him. We fed him some milk then released him.</p>

                <p>Applied and had been accepted as a Newhouse Ambassador for the summer! That was a great opportunity to learn about the school while share my experience to perspective students. I got my own ambassador T-shirt, name card, and student ID access to the Dick Clark Studio, and I have kept them and will keep them in the future.</p>

                <p>I took two 4-credit courses during the summer in Onondaga Community College, a biology and a statistic, for “science with lab” and “math with lab” requirements. The biology was in-person course that begins on 8am and end by 3pm with a 30-mins break. I remember that in the first class when I saw the syllabus I was planned to do well in labs, quizzes, and first three exams so I can skip the final exam but still get the credit for it, then I failed the first exam…HOWEVER I was successful got a B at the end and credit for it!</p>

                <p>In the next week, my second volunteer role of Newhouse Peer Advisor began! Since I was worked as a student ambassador for the summer, that was easy to welcome Newhouse freshmen and introduce the school to them.</p>

                <p>Got accepted into Event & Technical Service and work for Student Engagement, everyone here is friendly and helpful. I was barely attending events in my first year but now I participate the events in another way! I started my training to become a sound technician while work in some other positions that open to every student employee.</p>

                <p>I had spent the whole semester on figuring out if I want to do advertising or keep doing film, I understand that Newhouse has one of the top advertising programs in the US, and I can find a job easily after graduation. But I am not sure if I enjoy creating content that people always choose to skip while watching video. I changed my major and took an advertising class, then I realized that I don’t really want to do it for my whole life, </p>

                <p>Went to Watkins Glens State Park to catch the fall with my special one, we walked down through the Gorge Trail from the top of the mountain and expected to come back by shuttle. Unfortunately, there is no shuttle that day, so we had to walk back.  A bit tired but we were still happy since we saw wonderful views.</p>

                <p>Another coding class. Prof. Kingma was told me that many alumni point to IST359 as the most useful course they took for their careers, I believe that was true. Glad that I took this class with a good professor, Prof. Ferger. I thought SQL was easier than Python, or makes more sense to me probably. </p>
