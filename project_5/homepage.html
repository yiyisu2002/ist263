                <h2>Welcome to Yiyi's Page!</h2>
                <p>I am a sophomore from Syracuse University, dual enrolled in S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications and School of Information Studies, studying Television, Radio & Film and Information Management & Technology. I like films so I hope I can contribute to this industry, meanwhile I enjoy working on IT stuff. Therefore, I plan to work on a IT position in entertainment industry in the future, that probably sounds wired but I wish I can work in an environment that is not that serious, it should be fine :)</p>

            <p>I was born in Beijing China, and my family moved to the United States in 2016. I got my high school diploma in New York City, then I gaped for a year and began my journey of pursuing a bachelorâ€™s in science degree at Syracuse University.</p>
